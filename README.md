## CFD using FEM
This is a collection of CFD cases developed using [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/) on Google Colab. These cases are (partially) part of the program of the courses "Computational Fluid Dynamics" and "Numerical Analysis for Partial Differential Equations" held at Politecnico di Milano.
